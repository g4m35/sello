# HANDOFF

Living handoff doc. This project alternates between **Claude** and **Codex**
agents (the owner switches due to usage limits), so the next agent has no memory
of the last session. **Every agent MUST read this at session start and update it
before finishing.**

## How to use this file
- **Start of session:** read this top-to-bottom, plus `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
- **End of session (required):** update `Last updated`, prepend a dated bullet to
  `Recent work`, refresh `Current state`, `Blocked on owner`, and `Next up`. Keep
  it accurate over exhaustive. Never put secrets here.

## Last updated
2026-06-10 — Codex. Production eBay OAuth now returns to Sello, but the
settings page was showing all readiness items as missing from stored/default
readiness only: production Vercel logs after callback showed
`GET /api/marketplaces/ebay/readiness` 200 and no POST refresh call, so the app
had not actually queried eBay Account/Inventory APIs after consent. Added a
one-shot auto-refresh after connected readiness with no `checkedAt`, clarified
the connected-but-incomplete UI, changed connected actions so primary Connect is
hidden and Reconnect is secondary, and added tests for production API/token use
plus setup-required copy. Production publishing remains disabled. Local gate
passed: `npm run lint` (2 existing warnings in
`src/app/api/listings/draft/draft-actions.test.ts`), `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm
test` (266 passed), `npx prisma validate`, `npm run build`.

## Previous update
2026-06-10 — Claude. **Production eBay OAuth invalid_request RESOLVED.** Root
cause: `EBAY_REDIRECT_URI_NAME` held a truncated RuName missing the
eBay-username prefix (`JacobHel-sello--zdvqgoeck` instead of
`Jacob_Heller-JacobHel-sello--zdvqgoeck`). Owner supplied the exact portal
value; env var updated in Vercel Production, redeployed, and the server-built
authorize URL verified to land on signin.ebay.com (consent flow) instead of
errorOauth. Temporary diagnostics route removed. Also committed the Codex
README refresh that was left uncommitted on develop. Owner's next step:
sign in on sello.wtf → Settings → Connect eBay → complete eBay consent.

2026-06-10 — Codex. Replaced `README.md` on `develop` with the owner-provided
`/Users/jheller/Downloads/README_new.md` draft, reframing the project as Sello
and documenting current product status, setup, eBay guardrails, deployment,
security, roadmap, and development rules. Docs-only change; no commit, push, or
deploy. Verification gate passed after the README update: `npm run lint`
(2 existing warnings in `src/app/api/listings/draft/draft-actions.test.ts`),
`npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (260 passed), `npx prisma validate`,
`npm run build`.

## Previous update
2026-06-10 — Claude. **Production Connect eBay fails with invalid_request: root
cause is the RuName value.** Evidence (via temporary masked diagnostics route
`/api/marketplaces/ebay/oauth-diagnostics` + direct probes of auth.ebay.com):
authorize URL structure is correct; a bogus client_id yields
`unauthorized_client` while the real one yields `invalid_request`, so the App
ID is valid; the configured `EBAY_REDIRECT_URI_NAME`
(`JacobHel-sello--zdvqgoeck`, note the double dash) errors identically to a
nonexistent RuName → it does not match any RuName on the production keyset.
**Blocked on owner:** copy the exact production RuName from developer.ebay.com
(User Tokens → "Get a Token from eBay via Your Application" → eBay Redirect URL
name), confirm its "auth accepted URL" is
`https://sello.wtf/api/marketplaces/ebay/callback`, update
`EBAY_REDIRECT_URI_NAME` in Vercel Production, redeploy. Also shipped:
env-aware labels on /settings/marketplaces ("Production account"/"Connect eBay"
in production; sandbox wording only in sandbox), main @ `ea2d10a` deployed.
Remove the diagnostics route once connect reaches eBay login.

2026-06-09 — Claude. **Production eBay OAuth enabled and deployed** (main @
`1892879`, sello.wtf); EBAY_ENV accepts "production", publishing stays hard
sandbox-locked, all production eBay env vars set in Vercel (Sensitive/write-only;
EBAY_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY and EBAY_OAUTH_STATE_SECRET generated fresh,
EBAY_ENV=production via CLI). Then merged feature/ui (copy-text export +
structured measurements/flaws, incl. migration
`20260609120000_add_draft_measurements_flaws`) and feature/settings-landing
(settings landing page; sidebar gear no longer signs users out) into develop,
promoted to **main @ `0991f08` and deployed to production** (sello.wtf, all
routes verified live). Migration `add_draft_measurements_flaws` was applied to
the prod DB via `npm run db:deploy` BEFORE the deploy, as required. Owner's
next step: sign in on sello.wtf → Settings → Connect eBay and complete consent
on auth.ebay.com.

## Current state
- Repo `resale-crosslister`. Production: https://sello.wtf (Vercel project `jaky/resale-crosslister`), `main` @ `0991f08`.
- Production eBay OAuth/readiness live; publishing remains sandbox-only by design (hard gate in `publish.ts`). Production publish is the next deliberate build, not a flag flip.
- Latest readiness diagnosis: OAuth is connected, but prior UI did not POST-refresh readiness after consent; production policy/location missing state is not proven real until the deployed auto-refresh calls eBay and updates stored readiness.
- `develop` and `main` are effectively level (prod is current). Work in `worktrees/ui` (`feature/ui`).
- Worktrees: `resale-crosslister` → `develop`; `worktrees/ui` → `feature/ui` (active feature work).
- README on `develop` has been refreshed from the owner-provided Sello draft.
- Open PR **#1** (pre-existing "chore: optimize repo workflow") into `develop`.
- CodeRabbit auto-reviews enabled on `develop`.
- Gate on `develop`/`main`: `lint`, `tsc`, `vitest` (266 tests), `prisma validate`, `build` all green.

## Shipped to prod (all live now)
- Full app UI, Phase 0, Phase 1 comps pipeline (dormant — no comp source key).
- T1–T7 (lifecycle mark-sold/delist, responsive layout, auto-fetch comps, inventory
  grid/sort/pagination, photo set-cover, consistent loading/error states, tests).
- eBay account-deletion compliance endpoint (deployed, but **env not set yet** — see Blocked).

## Recent work (newest first)
- 2026-06-10 (Codex): diagnosed production eBay readiness display after successful OAuth. Confirmed code uses production eBay base URLs/token rows for `EBAY_ENV=production`, and Vercel logs showed only GET readiness after callback, no POST refresh. Added auto-refresh after connected/no-checkedAt readiness, clearer setup-required copy and Seller Hub links, secondary Reconnect behavior, production readiness route test, and view-model tests.
- 2026-06-10 (Codex): replaced `README.md` from `/Users/jheller/Downloads/README_new.md`; verified exact file match and ran `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm test`, `npx prisma validate`, and `npm run build` (pass; lint still has 2 existing warnings in `draft-actions.test.ts`, tests now 260 passed).
- 2026-06-09 (Claude): merge-readiness review of the two feature/ui commits (merged). Verified migration safety, legacy-draft compat (new reset/duplicate tests), seller scoping, no eBay coupling. Fixed: editor let sellers exceed the draft schema's row/length caps (12 rows; label 80 / value 40 / description 400), making autosave 400 with only a generic "Save failed".
- 2026-06-09 (Claude): settings landing page at `/settings` inside the app shell (eBay connection status + manage, account name/email/sign-out, privacy link); sidebar gets a real Settings nav item and the footer gear (which silently called signOut and bounced users to login) now uses a logout icon. `feature/settings-landing` -> develop.
- 2026-06-09 (Claude): structured measurements + flaws (merged from `feature/ui`). `MeasurementSchema`/`FlawSchema` in `src/lib/ai/listing-draft.ts` (defaulted `[]` so old `validatedJson` still parses; reset/duplicate preserve them), Gemini prompt v2 (never invent measurements; placeholders with `value: null`; only visible flaws; never claim "no flaws"), nullable JSONB columns on `ListingDraft` (additive migration), editable Measurements/Flaws sections on `/inventory/[id]` (rows the seller edits get `source: "seller"`), exports prefer structured data with itemSpecifics-heuristic fallback for old drafts.
- 2026-06-09 (Claude): copy/paste listing export for Depop/Poshmark/Grailed (merged from `feature/ui`). Pure formatters in `src/lib/marketplace/export-formatters.ts`, route `GET /api/listings/[id]/export?marketplace=…` (typed `{marketplace, title, body, warnings}`; 400 bad marketplace, 401, 404 cross-seller), "Copy listing text" card on `/inventory/[id]` with per-marketplace copy buttons + warning banner. Honest copy-only: no publishing claimed.
- 2026-06-09 (Claude): production eBay OAuth enablement (feature/ebay-production-oauth -> develop -> main @ 1892879, deployed). EBAY_ENV="production" accepted; env-keyed auth/token/API URLs; connection scoping by config environment in callback/readiness/disconnect; new getEbayEnvironment() so disconnect/stored-readiness work without full credentials; publish hard-locked to sandbox (typed not_enabled in production, zero outbound calls, regression-tested). Set Vercel Production env: EBAY_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY + EBAY_OAUTH_STATE_SECRET (freshly generated), EBAY_ENV=production. EBAY_CLIENT_ID/SECRET/REDIRECT_URI_NAME were added by owner. Stray empty vars EBAY_RU_NAME / EBAY_PRODUCTION_RU_NAME remain in Vercel; safe to delete.
- 2026-06-09 (Claude): promoted develop -> main (PR #25) and deployed to production (main @ 27b7151, sello.wtf). All prior develop work now live. Account-deletion GET still returns 500 in prod until its env vars are set.
- 2026-06-09 (Claude): eBay account-deletion compliance endpoint `/api/marketplaces/ebay/account-deletion` (GET challenge hash, POST ack + best-effort connection purge + JobLog audit) + tests.
- 2026-06-09 (Claude): removed eBay Marketplace Insights source (eBay restricted access); StockX is now primary sold-comp path.
- 2026-06-09 (Claude): reframed CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md for the full product (dropped MVP scope caps; kept integrity + deploy-safety).
- 2026-06-09 (Claude): T1–T7 autonomous batch on develop (see above).
- 2026-06-08 (Claude): Phase 0 + Phase 1 built, verified, deployed to prod; magic-link + env-config fixes; comps pipeline.

## Blocked on owner (credentials / decisions — not code)
- **Comp source key** (to light up automatic pricing): `STOCKX_API_KEY` (primary sold, needs partner approval), or `EBAY_BROWSE_CLIENT_ID`/`EBAY_BROWSE_CLIENT_SECRET` (interim active, prod keyset), or a third-party aggregator key. Add in Vercel env.
- **eBay production seller setup**: after the deployed auto-refresh, if payment, fulfillment, return policy, or inventory location remain missing, the owner needs to create them in eBay Seller Hub for the connected production seller account, then click Refresh Readiness.
- **eBay production publishing**: code decision + build (OAuth is done; publish gate stays locked until built and approved).
- **Stripe keys** for monetization.
- **Worker host** (Railway/Render/Fly, or Vercel Cron) for queues + inventory sync.
- **`.env.example`**: still needs the two `EBAY_MARKETPLACE_DELETION_*` lines (agents are sandbox-blocked from editing env files; owner adds them).
- **Account-deletion go-live**: set `EBAY_MARKETPLACE_DELETION_VERIFICATION_TOKEN` (owner-chosen, 32–80 chars) and `EBAY_MARKETPLACE_DELETION_ENDPOINT` (= `https://sello.wtf/api/marketplaces/ebay/account-deletion`) in Vercel Production, deploy, then register URL + token in the eBay developer portal.

## Next up (priority order)
1. Wire the **StockX comp source** (env-gated by `STOCKX_API_KEY`) following the `CompSource` pattern in `src/lib/comps/`. eBay Browse source already implemented. Stays honest/empty without a key.
2. **Real eBay publishing**: production OAuth consent + Sell Inventory/Offer publish path, replacing the 501 stub, gated on prod eBay credentials.
3. **Stripe subscriptions** (gated on Stripe keys).
4. **Background worker host** + inventory sync (sold detection, double-sell prevention).

## Resume checklist
1. `cd "/Users/jheller/Desktop/perc 30/worktrees/ui"` (the `feature/ui` worktree).
2. `git fetch && git merge origin/develop` (stay current); `npm install`; `npx prisma generate`.
3. Gate: `npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit && npm test && npm run build`.
4. Flow: `feature/* → develop → main → production`. Commit + merge to `develop`. **Never push `main` or deploy to production without explicit owner approval.** Preview deploys are fine on request.

## Key gotchas
- **Next.js 16**: read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing Next code; `params`/`searchParams` are async; use `next/font`.
- **ESLint `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` is an error**: do data fetching in an async function defined *inside* the effect; trigger refetches via a `reloadKey` state, not by calling a setState-bearing `useCallback` in the effect.
- **DB env**: runtime reads `DATABASE_URL` (the `resale_app` pooler role); don't switch to the postgres owner. Vercel also injects `POSTGRES_*` — keep `DATABASE_URL` set explicitly. `getRequiredEnv()` rejects any value containing `[`.
- **Integrity**: never fake publishing/comps; never invent prices; no secrets in code/logs/this file; scope every query to the seller.
